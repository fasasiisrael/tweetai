## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/fasasiisrael/tweetai.git
cd tweetai
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
\`\`\`

## Starting the Server

To start the server, you have two options:

### 1. Start in Production Mode

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

### 2. Start in Development Mode (with Hot Reloading)

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

This will start the server using \`nodemon\`, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

## Building the Project

Before deploying, you can build the project. This involves building the frontend and bundling the Swagger documentation.

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

### 1. Build the Frontend

\`\`\`bash
npm run build:frontend
\`\`\`

This will compile and minify the Vue.js frontend for production.

### 2. Bundle the Swagger Documentation

\`\`\`bash
npm run build:swagger
\`\`\`

This will bundle the Swagger documentation into a single JSON file located in the \`public\` directory.

## Database Setup

### 1. Configure the Database

Create a \`.env\` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

\`\`\`env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/tweetai
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
\`\`\`

### 2. Create the Database

Make sure you have MySQL installed and running. Then, create the database using the MySQL CLI or any MySQL GUI tool:

\`\`\`sql
CREATE DATABASE tweetai;
\`\`\`

## Running Migrations

After setting up the database, run the following command to apply all database migrations:

\`\`\`bash
npm run migrate
\`\`\`

### Seeding the Database

If you have seeders to populate the database with initial data, you can run:

\`\`\`bash
npm run seed
\`\`\`

## Swagger Documentation

Swagger documentation for the API is available at the \`/api-docs\` endpoint after starting the server.

### Start Swagger UI

To serve the Swagger UI:

\`\`\`bash
npm run swagger
\`\`\`

The Swagger documentation will be accessible at \`http://localhost:3000/api-docs\`.
